# Known panics

 - Extended network dropouts:

    ```
    thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error(Io(Error { repr: Os { code: 101, message: "Network is unreachable" } })
    ```

 - Poorly formatted toml configuration
 - Various failures connecting to the IRC server, needs added exception handling.
